The plan here is to build a board game app where users can create an account, login, play multiplayer on the same machine or play against their friends!

Right now, you can create a user and login to that account to see your games - game state saves after each move you make and is retrieved when you log in again with the same user name (password not yet implemented - enter user name and click "sign in") on home page

Mobile version does not yet support signing in and saving - try on a laptop to use that functionality

Short term goals:   refactor redux - match reducers to actions instead of basic set state
                    sign in on mobile
                    styling

Long term goals:     multiplayer
